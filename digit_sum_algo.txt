ALGORITHM

STEPS

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Input the number whose digit sum is to be calculated in NUMBER 
        and initialize a variable SUM=0.

Step 3: Repeat step 4 and Step 5 untill the NUMBER is greater than 10.

Step 4: Find the remainder of the NUMBER and add it to the SUM i.e. SUM = SUM + NUMBER.

Step 5: Now divide the NUMBER by 10 and store it in the NUMBER itself.  

Step 6: Now at last add the NUMBER to the SUM.

Step 7: The Sum is the required Sum of digits.

Step 8: Exit.
